Unit Test in Python using unittest and pytest package

## Why do we write unit test?
- Writing the unit test forces you to think carefully about how that unit should be used.
- Test help to document the system you are building.
- Forces you to design your units.
- Protects you from regression failures.

### Unit Test helps you understand what to build

- Forces you to think you in detail.

### Documenting the Units

- Sepecify the behaviour of the unit undet test.
- How the original developer intended the unit to be used.
- Executable: keeps in sync with the unit under the test.

<!-- ### Design the units
-  -->

### Limitation of Unit Tests
- Hard to write unit test if you have many dependenices between yout units
- Test scenarios may not occur in production
- Unit Test cannot find integration errors

## When to write Test Cases?

### Test-Last Process

- Test comes after the code
- Test when design is stable
- You may find the design you have setteled on is not very testable.
- Risk of untestable design
- Tests are rushed

### Test-First Process

- All Tests are written early
- Design is testable
- Hard to predict all cases
- You will end up iterating

### Test-Driven Development

- The tests drive the process
- Takes discipline
- Refactoring takes skill
